## Introduction 

This report outlines the process and insights derived from Competitor and Market Research for fintech Product Development. The purpose of this project is to assist a fintench startup, Pedmonie to develop a new solution aimed at simplifying digital payment acceptance. The product consolidates multiple payment models like mobile money, bank transfers, and card payment into a unified system, offering businesses a streamlined way to manage transactions, reduce complexity and improve success rates. Since the product is in its early development stage, my task as a Data Analyst was to conduct thorough market research, analyze competitors, and provide insights to support product refinement and differentiation.


## Research Goals of the project

The following are the research goals of the project

1. 	Collaborate with Product Managers: Work closely with the product management team to gain a deep understanding of the product vision, features, and intended value proposition.

   b. Product details and features
   c.	Unique selling points (USPs)
   d.	Problems they are solving
   e.	Opportunities for differentiation: How can we improve on their offerings? What additional features can make our product stand out?

4.	Data transformation: I converted raw data into meaningful formats (e.g., categorizing payment models) and normalized or aggregate data for better comparison across competitors to get a transformed dataset suitable for in-depth analysis.
5.	Data Analysis: I performed descriptive analysis to understand user needs and competitor strengths, Conducted SWOT analysis to identify opportunities and threats and Analyzed transaction trends and pain points to identify key areas for improvement.
